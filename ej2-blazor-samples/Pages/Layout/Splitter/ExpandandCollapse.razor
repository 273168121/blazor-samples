While the idea seems simple enough, the implications of such networks are staggering—think optical character recognition, speech recognition, and regression analysis. With Neural Networks Using C# Succinctly by James McCaffrey, you’ll learn how to create your own neural network to solve classification problems, or problems where the outcomes can only be one of several values." size = "35%" collapsible = "true" ></splitterpane>
